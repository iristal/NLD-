# NLD++


This is the source code implementing the non-local single image dehazing algorithm described in the paper "NLDNet++: A Physics Based Single Image Dehazing Network"
This code is based on the following work:
[Non-Local Image Dehazing. Berman, D. and Treibitz, T. and Avidan S., CVPR2016](https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~berman/NonLocalDehazing/NonLocalDehazing_CVPR2016.pdf)


If you use this code, please cite both papers.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements:
The code requires MATLAB, and was tested on windows.

### Demo
1. Change MATLAB's directory to the folder the code was extracted to.
2. Run the file demo.m in order to see the algorithm's perfomance on included images (in the 'images' folder).
